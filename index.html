  #### Take One Leave One is an initiative to help rough sleepers and homeless this winter with Twitter support from Gary Linekar, Rob Delaney and Emily Maitlis

  As temperatures plummet, an initiative offering a way for people to help rough-sleepers has launched in London and is rolling out across hte UK and around the world.

  Take One Leave One is a surprisingly simple way to help the homeless by offering warm clothing to rough sleepers, homeless and those feeling the hardship of lockdown.

  Beside a sign reading "If you are cold take one, if you can help leave one", a clothes rail is filled and refilled each day with clothes provided by people living and working in the area. Anyone in need of a coat, scarf or hat helps themselves.
