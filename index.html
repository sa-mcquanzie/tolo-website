about-body: <p><strong>Take One Leave One</strong> is an initiative to help rough
  sleepers and homeless, with Twitter support from Gary Linekar, Rob Delaney and Emily
  Maitlis.</p><p>As temperatures plummet, an initiative offering a way for people
  to help rough-sleepers has launched in London and is rolling out across the UK and
  around the world.</p><p>Take One Leave One is a surprisingly simple way to help
  the homeless by offering warm clothing to rough sleepers, homeless and those feeling
  the hardship of lockdown. Beside a sign reading "If you are cold take one, if you
  can help leave one", a clothes rail is filled and refilled each day with clothes
  provided by people living and working in the area. Anyone in need of a coat, scarf
  or hat helps themselves.</p>
